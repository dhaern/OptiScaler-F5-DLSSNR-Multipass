// The contract between a game-API adapter and the native input producer (DLSS-NR in a game that makes no upscaler call).
//
// The producer (optical flow, trust mask, guides, DLSS-NR) runs on one D3D12 device and knows nothing of the game's API. An
// adapter (Dx12 today; D3D11, D3D10 and D3D9 later) does the rest: it observes how the game uses depth (native/DepthFinderCore.h),
// and once per presented frame it hands the producer a FrameInput, and takes the FrameOutput back. Everything crosses as D3D12
// resources and fence points, never as pointers into the game's API, so the same contract works when the adapter lives in
// another process (the 32-bit bridge) and the resources are shared handles. See docs/NATIVE-INPUT-ADAPTERS.md.

// larger of the two moves by exactly 1 per frame: a dxvk game ticks both, on different threads, and a native Vulkan game
